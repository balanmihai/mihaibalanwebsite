Second-Highest Volcano in Asia. A week trip to Turkey, Armenia and Iran

## First of all: why?

All the preparation and rigorous training I've dedicated myself to over the past few years have seemed to lead to this expedition. Last summer I watched a documentary about this Islamic area and started reading everything about the climb, people, culture and culinary traditions. Stay tuned, as I'm about to share all the essential insights and tips you should be aware of before you embark on your own high-altitude climbing expedition!

Mount Ararat is the natural border for Turkey, Armenia, Iran and part the Western part of Azerbaijan. This is a high conflict zone so getting a life insurance for extreme sports was a whole hustle - I used to hear gun shots coming from the Iran border during the night.

## Training

Rock climbing, endurance unmakerd trails, multi-day hikes, winter mountaineering, semi-marathons and being part of the Romanian Alpine Club were the key elements for my preparation.

Running long distances increases your overall endurance while sprint running will develope your VO2 Max. Also short slow runs and resting days are crucial for a healthy lifestyle.

Saddly, there is no specific training for climbing high altitude mountains. Every person handles altitude differently and is usually based on genetics, overall long term lifestyle and prior experiences. You can usually feel it starting from 2500m and it highly affects you from 4000m.

Mount Ararat is not a technical mountain. With months of proper training, anyone can handle most of it.

## Equipment:

In mountaineering the rule of thumb is: there is no such thing as bad weather, just not appropriate equipment.

In the middle East, the days were very hot ( 30deg C ) while the nights were very cold ( slept at -12deg C in the Second Camp 4200m ) and since snow storms are very common,  I had to consider EVERY type of scenario when choosing the equipment. I had to carry hiking gear for both dry, rainy conditions and the technical side of the trail ( 50deg incline; steep climbs on artic fields using the helmet and ice axe, three layers of alpine gloves, ice crampons and high altitude boots).

Emergency kit: pills for headaches, stomachaches and flu, survival foil and bandages

Miscellaneous: sun screen, electrolytes tablets, head torch + hygiene items

Food and Hydratation and Health Issues:

We had a team of 2 guides, 5 horses as porters, 3 cooks with us. The food was really good, we had 3 meals everyday and an avarage of 6L of water and tea per person/ day.

## Hydratation
is by far the most important aspect of a high altitude ascent. Your body consumes so much energy to keep you alive in those rough conditions. With little to no oxygen, you have to drink liquids constantly even if you don’t feel the need of doing so. It can easily lead to **Acute Mountain Sickness:**

- headaches
- stomachaches
- sleep deprivation
- dizziness

## High Altitude
Pulmonary Edema and High Altitude Cerebral Edema are two serious issues that can occur if you are:

- rapid ascenting - we used to go very very slow with the guide’s pace. A faster rythm can INSTANTLY lead to painful headaches
- not acclimatize - the rule of thumb is to go climb high, return and sleep low as can be seen in our schedule.
